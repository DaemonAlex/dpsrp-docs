## Finding Your Path

> **RP Scenario:**
> *You push open the door to Downtown Cab Co. A dispatcher looks up from her crossword puzzle. "You here about the job?" You nod. She slides a clipboard across the desk. "Fill this out. You got a license?" You hesitate. "...I can get one?" She laughs. "Kid, half our drivers learned on the job. Just don't hit anything expensive."*

## The Real Secret

Here's what nobody tells you:

**The job doesn't matter. The story does.**

The best mechanic RP isn't about fixing cars - it's about the regular customer whose car keeps breaking down because they can't afford a new one. It's about the late-night tow where you find something in the trunk you shouldn't have seen.

The best cop RP isn't about arrests - it's about the kid you let go with a warning who shows up years later to thank you.

**Every job is just a setting. You bring the story.**
