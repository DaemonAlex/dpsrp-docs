*Build your manufacturing empire from the ground up*

## The Industrial Path

> *The factory floor hums with machinery. Conveyor belts carry products from station to station. Workers move with practiced efficiency. And in the office above, you watch it all through the glass - YOUR factory, YOUR empire, YOUR vision. A year ago, you were broke. Now you're an industrialist.*

Factory ownership represents the ultimate goal for ambitious entrepreneurs. Buy a facility, set up production lines, hire workers, and turn raw materials into profit. It's not easy - but nothing worth having is.

## Understanding Factories

### What Is a Factory?

A factory is a business property where you:
- **Produce goods** from raw materials
- **Hire workers** to run operations
- **Sell products** for profit
- **Build an empire** through expansion

### The Business Model

```
RAW MATERIALS → PRODUCTION → FINISHED GOODS → SALES = PROFIT
```

Every factory follows this flow. Master it, and you'll never be poor again.

## Purchasing a Factory

### Finding Properties

1. Look for factory icons on the map
2. Visit the location in person
3. Check availability status
4. Access the purchase menu

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Funds** | Full purchase price in bank |
| **Reputation** | Some require standing |
| **No Conflicts** | Can't own competing factories |

> **RP Scenario:**
> *"This place has been empty for months." The real estate agent kicks at the dusty floor. "Previous owner couldn't make payments. You see potential?" You look around at the rusted equipment, the broken windows, the possibilities. "How much?" She names a figure. You smile. "I'll take it."*

## The Factory Interface

### Main Dashboard

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Production Lines** | Design and manage manufacturing |
| **Stock** | Current inventory levels |
| **Employees** | Staff management |
| **Upgrades** | Improve your facility |
| **Bank** | Factory finances |
| **Statistics** | Performance tracking |

---

## Production System

### The Flow

Every factory operates on this principle:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Farms** | Generate raw materials |
| **Transport** | Move materials within facility |
| **Machines** | Process materials into products |
| **Storage** | Hold finished goods |
| **Sales** | Ship products for payment |

### Setting Up Production Lines

The factory uses a **flowchart interface**:

1. **Place Farms** - These generate your base resources
   - Wood, water, coal, chemicals
   - Each produces specific materials

2. **Connect Machines** - Processing equipment
   - Different machines for different products
   - Can be upgraded for efficiency

3. **Add Transport** - Internal logistics
   - Move materials between stations
   - Faster transport = more output

4. **Link to Storage** - Hold finished products
   - Capacity limits apply
   - Sell before overflow

> **The Production Line:**
> *On screen, the flowchart glows. Raw materials feed into Machine A, which outputs to Machine B, which sends finished products to storage. You drag another connection, adding a third machine. Production doubles. This is industrial optimization.*

## Supplies

### Getting Materials

**Option A: Buy Supplies**

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Safe | No risk |
| Convenient | Instant delivery |
| Reliable | Always available |
| Costly | Eat into profits |

**Option B: Steal Supplies**

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Free | No cost |
| Risky | Missions required |
| Limited | Less per run |
| Exciting | Great RP |

> **The Heist:**
> *"The warehouse security changes shifts at midnight. That's our window." Your crew nods. This supply run saves you $50,000 - enough to fund next week's production. But if you get caught? That's a different kind of cost.*

### Supply Types

| Material | Used For |
|----------|----------|
| **Raw Resources** | Base production |
| **Components** | Advanced manufacturing |
| **Chemicals** | Specialty products |
| **Energy** | Power equipment |

---

## Selling Products

### The Trademarket

Your primary sales channel:
- Set your own prices
- Sell to other players
- Buy from competitors
- Track market trends

### Sale Locations

Distance affects payment:

| Location | Price Multiplier |
|----------|------------------|
| **Los Santos** | Base price |
| **Blaine County** | +33% |
| **Paleto Bay** | +78% |

**The Rule:** Farther = More money, More risk

> **The Delivery:**
> *"Paleto Bay run. Fifty units." The driver groans. "That's across the map." You check the numbers. Base price: $45,000. Paleto price: $80,000. "Worth the drive," you say. He sighs, fires up the truck. In this business, distance is money.*

## Upgrades

### Available Improvements

| Upgrade | Effect | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Stock Capacity** | Hold more inventory | Medium |
| **Machine Efficiency** | Faster production | High |
| **Garage** | More delivery vehicles | Medium |
| **Production Lines** | Additional chains | Later |
| **Security** | Reduce raid chance | High |

### Upgrade Strategy

1. **Security First** - Protect what you build
2. **Machines Second** - Output equals income
3. **Storage Third** - Capacity to stockpile
4. **Lines Last** - Expand when stable

> **Pro Tip:** An unprotected factory is a target. Invest in security before you scale up.

## Employee Management

### Building Your Team

| Role | What They Do | Permissions |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Worker** | Run production | Basic access |
| **Driver** | Handle deliveries | Transport only |
| **Manager** | Day-to-day operations | Most functions |
| **Co-Owner** | Full partnership | Nearly everything |

### Hiring Smart

1. **Interview first** - Know who you're hiring
2. **Start low** - Workers can earn trust
3. **Pay fairly** - Good pay = loyal staff
4. **Monitor performance** - Track productivity

> **RP Scenario:**
> *"I need someone I can trust." The applicant nods. "I show up on time, keep my mouth shut, and do my job." You study their face. Something about them seems reliable. "Alright. You start tomorrow. Don't make me regret this."*

## Factory Finances

### The Factory Bank

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Income Deposits** | All sales go here |
| **Expense Payments** | Supplies, wages |
| **Balance Tracking** | Know your position |
| **Profit Withdrawal** | Transfer to personal |

### Managing Cash Flow

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Keep operating funds | Cover supplies and wages |
| Sell regularly | Don't let product sit |
| Track expenses | Know where money goes |
| Reinvest wisely | Growth requires capital |

## Security & Raids

### The Threat

Factories can be raided. Prepare for it.

| Prevention | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Security upgrades | Major protection |
| Low stock | Less to lose |
| Regular sales | Don't stockpile |
| Good standing | Community defense |

### If You Get Raided

1. **Stay calm** - It happens to everyone
2. **Assess losses** - What was taken?
3. **Rebuild** - Resupply and restart
4. **Upgrade** - Prevent future raids

> **The Raid:**
> *You get the call at 3 AM. "They hit the factory." By the time you arrive, half your inventory is gone. The security system wasn't enough. Lesson learned. Time to upgrade.*

## Statistics & Analytics

### What to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Total Production** | Output efficiency |
| **Sales History** | Income trends |
| **Profit Margins** | Real earnings |
| **Employee Productivity** | Staff value |
| **Supply Consumption** | Cost tracking |

### Using Data

- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize production
- Track profitability
- Plan expansion

## Tips for Success

### Starting Out

1. **Start small** - Learn the systems first
2. **Reinvest everything** - Growth before profit
3. **Balance production** - Match supply to demand
4. **Sell regularly** - Cash flow is king

### Scaling Up

1. **Hire help** - You can't do it alone
2. **Upgrade strategically** - Security, then efficiency
3. **Network** - Partner with other owners
4. **Diversify** - Multiple product lines

### Empire Building

1. **Multiple factories** - Different products
2. **Vertical integration** - Own your supply chain
3. **Market domination** - Corner specific goods
4. **Passive income** - Let managers run daily ops

> **The Empire:**
> *Three factories. Twelve employees. Products shipping across San Andreas every day. You sit in your office, watching the numbers roll in. You built this from nothing. Every decision, every risk, every sleepless night - it led here. This is what success looks like.*

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No security | Raids devastate |
| Ignoring supplies | Production stops |
| Hoarding products | Storage full, waste |
| Underpaying staff | Turnover and theft |
| No reinvestment | Stagnation |

---

## The Factory Owner's Mindset

> *"A factory isn't just a building. It's a machine, and you're the engineer. Every part has to work together. The supplies, the production, the sales, the people - one weak link breaks the whole chain. Your job is to make sure there are no weak links."*

Factory ownership isn't for everyone. It requires:
- **Capital** to start
- **Time** to manage
- **People skills** to hire and lead
- **Business sense** to profit

But for those who master it? The rewards are substantial.

**Start building. Start producing. Start winning.**
