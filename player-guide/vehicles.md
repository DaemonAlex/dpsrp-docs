## Getting Your First Set of Wheels

Nothing says "I've made it" like your first car. Sure, you could take the bus. Walk. Beg for rides. But eventually, you need **your own wheels**.

> **The Moment:**
> *You hand over the cash. The salesman grins. The keys drop into your palm. You slide into the driver's seat, inhale that new car smell (or in your case, slightly used car smell), and turn the ignition. The engine rumbles. You pull out of the lot. This is freedom.*

### Pro Tips

| Tip | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Don't run empty** | Getting stranded sucks |
| **Jerry cans** | Emergency backup |
| **Electric vehicles** | Need charging stations |
| **Tank sizes vary** | Sports cars burn more |

> **Stranded:**
> *The engine sputters. Coughs. Dies. You coast to the shoulder, staring at the fuel gauge. Empty. In the middle of nowhere. No phone signal. It's getting dark. Maybe you should've stopped at that last station after all.*
