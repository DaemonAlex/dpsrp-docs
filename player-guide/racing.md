*When the sun goes down, the real racing begins*

## The Underground Scene

> *2 AM. Empty streets. Your hands grip the wheel as engines rumble around you. Someone walks to the middle of the road, arms raised. "On my signal!" The crowd goes quiet. Your foot hovers over the gas. This is what you've trained for. This is everything. Arms drop. FLOOR IT.*

Los Santos has a thriving underground racing scene - from organized drag strips to illegal street races through downtown. If you've got the car and the courage, there's always someone willing to race.

*Pure acceleration. No corners. No excuses.*

### What It Is

Quarter-mile straight-line racing. Two cars, one finish line, no turns. Pure power.

### The Drag Strip

**Location:** LSIA Airport runway area
- Official strip with timing equipment

- Recorded times and leaderboards

### How to Race

1. **Arrive** - Drive to the drag strip
2. **Queue Up** - Join the line or challenge someone
3. **Stage** - Position at the starting line
4. **Wait** - Watch the lights
5. **Launch** - GREEN means GO
6. **Finish** - First across wins

> **RP Scenario:**
> *The Christmas tree lights count down. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. You watch, foot ready. GREEN! Tires scream. G-force pins you to the seat. In four seconds, it's over. You glance at the time board. 9.8 seconds. Personal best. The crowd cheers.*

### Staging

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Pre-Stage** | Approaching the line |
| **Staged** | Positioned, ready |
| **Lights** | Yellow countdown |

### Reaction Time

Your reaction matters:
- **Perfect:** 0.000 seconds

## Street Racing

![JDM Scene](../images/racing/jdm-race.webp)

*The streets of Los Santos - your racetrack*

### The Underground

Organized illegal racing through city streets. Checkpoints. Betting. Police. Everything that makes it dangerous makes it exciting.

### Finding Races

Races appear as blips on your map. Or know the right people.

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/createrace [length] [category] [bet]` | Create a new race |
| `/startrace` | Start immediately |
| `/stoprace` | Cancel the race |
| `/racestats` | View your statistics |
| `/racename [name]` | Set your racer name |
| `/raceready` | Signal ready to race |
| `/racecategory` | Check your car's class |

### Creating a Race

1. Position where you want to start
2. Use the create command:
   - **Length:** `short` (15 checkpoints), `normal` (40), `long` (80)
   - **Category:** `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` (vehicle class)
   - **Bet:** Entry fee amount
3. Race generates automatically
4. Blip appears for other players

> **RP Scenario:**
> *"Fifty thousand. Winner takes all." You count the bills, add them to the pot. Twelve racers. $600,000 in the middle. The organizer nods. "Checkpoints are live. First to finish, don't get caught." You slide into your seat. This is either going to be your best night or your worst.*

| **C** | Muscle/Tuners | Dominator, Sultan RS |

| **Long** | 80 | 90 seconds |

### The Police Problem

**Street racing is illegal.** If cops show up:

| Option | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Outrun them** | High, but keeps the race going |
| **Scatter** | Medium, everyone for themselves |
| **Pull over** | Low risk, guaranteed ticket |

> **The Chase:**
> *Sirens behind you. Lights in your mirror. "Cops!" someone yells on the radio. You're in third place, two checkpoints from the finish. Do you stop? Do you run? Decision time. You floor it. The finish line is RIGHT THERE...*

2. **Stay straight** - No drifting off course

4. **Reduce weight** - Every pound counts

### Street Racing

1. **Scout the course** - Drive it before race day
2. **Know escape routes** - In case of cops
3. **Bring backup money** - If you lose the bet
4. **Trust your crew** - They watch your back

## The Racing Life

> *It's not about the money. Not really. The bets, the prizes - that's just how you keep score. It's about the moment. That second when everything's perfect - you, the car, the road. When you hit that apex just right, feel the grip, power through. That's what you chase. That's why you race.*

The best racers in Los Santos aren't just fast. They're smart. They know their cars. They respect the competition. They race clean and win clean.
