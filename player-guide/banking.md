*Where fortunes are managed, laundered, and occasionally stolen*

## The Financial District

> *You stare at the balance on the screen. Six figures. A year ago, you had nothing - just the clothes on your back and a bus ticket to Los Santos. Now? Now you're looking at your future. Every deposit, every hustle, every late night - it's all right there in those numbers. Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.*

Money makes Los Santos spin. Whether you're depositing your first paycheck or managing millions across multiple accounts, understanding the banking system is essential.

## Maze Bank

The undisputed king of Los Santos finance. If money moves in this city, Maze Bank probably touched it.

### Branch Locations

| Location | Type | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Downtown Tower** | Main Branch | Large transactions, business accounts |
| **Pillbox Hill** | Full Branch | Central, always busy |
| **Del Perro** | Branch | Beach side access |
| **Paleto Bay** | Small Branch | Rural banking |
| **Various ATMs** | Self-Service | Quick deposits/withdrawals |

> **RP Scenario:**
> *The line at Maze Bank is always long. You shuffle forward, watching the businessman ahead argue with the teller about wire limits. "Sir, for transactions over $50,000, we need additional verification—" He slams his fist on the counter. Security tenses. Welcome to downtown banking.*

## Understanding Your Money

### Two Wallets, Two Worlds

| Type | Where It Lives | Risk Level |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Cash** | Your pocket | **HIGH** - Can be robbed |
| **Bank** | Digital account | **LOW** - Secure |

> **The Hard Lesson:**
> *"Hands up! Everything in your pockets!" The gun's in your face before you can react. You empty your pockets. $5,000 - tonight's earnings. Gone. As the robber runs off, you curse yourself. Why didn't you just deposit it? The ATM was right there.*

### The Golden Rule

**Bank your money. Immediately. Always.**

Cash on hand = cash at risk. Every dollar in your bank is a dollar that can't be stolen at gunpoint.

## Basic Transactions

> **RP Scenario:**
> *"The money's in your account." You refresh the banking app. There it is - $50,000, just like he promised. "Pleasure doing business," you say into the phone. "The shipment arrives tonight." You hang up. Clean transaction. No paper trail. The way business should be.*

### Receiving Money

When someone sends you money:
- Notification on your phone
- Funds instantly available
- Check transaction history for details

---

## Phone Banking

Your phone makes banking portable.

### Banking App Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Balance Check** | See current funds |
| **Quick Transfer** | Send money fast |
| **Transaction History** | View recent activity |
| **Bill Pay** | Handle automatic payments |
| **Notifications** | Deposit/withdrawal alerts |

### When to Use Phone Banking

- Quick balance checks
- Sending money to friends
- Checking if a payment arrived
- Managing while on the go

> **The Convenience:**
> *You're at the bar, third drink in, when your phone buzzes. Payment received: $25,000. The job's done. You smile, order another round. "This one's on me," you tell your crew. Phone banking - the future of crime.*

## Business Banking

### For Business Owners

If you run a business, you have access to:

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Company Account** | Separate from personal |
| **Payroll** | Pay employees |
| **Deposits** | Business income |
| **Withdrawals** | Business expenses |
| **Transaction Log** | Track everything |

### Society Funds

Whitelisted jobs have society accounts:
- Police departments
- EMS/Hospital
- Mechanic shops
- Restaurants and bars

> **The Boss's Burden:**
> *"We need new equipment." Your employee looks at you expectantly. You check the society funds. Barely enough to cover payroll. "I'll... see what I can do." Running a business isn't just about making money. It's about keeping the lights on when things get tight.*

## Security & Safety

### Protecting Your Wealth

|----------|--------------|
| **Inside banks** | Safest |
| **Police stations** | Very safe |
| **Gas stations** | Medium |
| **Remote areas** | Risky |
| **Dark alleys** | Asking for trouble |

> **The Setup:**
> *The ATM beeps. Transaction complete. You turn to leave and there they are - three guys, spread out to block the exits. "That was a nice deposit," one says. "Why don't you take it back out?" Your heart sinks. Wrong ATM. Wrong time.*

## Financial Planning

### Building Wealth

| Strategy | How It Works |

## Common Mistakes

### What NOT to Do

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Carrying all your cash | One robbery = broke |
| Public withdrawals | Target on your back |
| Ignoring notifications | Miss important payments |
| Lending without records | "What money?" |
| Trusting strangers | Scams are real |

> **The Lesson:**
> *"I'll pay you back tomorrow." That was three weeks ago. You've seen him driving a new car, flashing cash at the club. But your $10,000? Gone. No receipt. No record. Just a promise from someone you thought was a friend.*
