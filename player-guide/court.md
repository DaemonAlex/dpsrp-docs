# Court System

*"Order in the court! All rise for the Honorable Judge..."*

Welcome to the San Andreas District Court, where justice is served, deals are made, and the drama of the courtroom unfolds daily.

## Your Day in Court

Whether you're fighting a traffic ticket, suing your neighbor for running over your lawn gnome, or defending yourself against serious charges, the courthouse is where it all happens.

### Where to Go

Head to **City Hall** in downtown Los Santos. Inside you'll find:
- The main courtroom with jury seating
- Reception desk for filing cases
- Bar Association office
- Judge's chambers

## Playing Your Part

### As a Defendant

So you got caught doing something... questionable. Here's what to expect:

1. **Get summoned** - You'll receive an email on your phone
2. **Show up on time** - Missing court = bad news (warrants, fines)
3. **Dress the part** - Maybe lose the ski mask for court day
4. **Decide on representation**:
   - Hire a slick defense attorney
   - Request a public defender
   - Represent yourself (bold move, Cotton)

**Pro tip:** Whatever you do, DON'T lose your cool in court. Judges don't appreciate outbursts, and it hurts your case.

### As a Juror

Fancy getting paid to judge other people's life choices? Jury duty might be for you!

1. Visit the jury seating area in the courtroom
2. Sign up for available cases and pocket **$1,000** just for showing up
3. Attend the trial, listen to both sides
4. Deliberate with your fellow jurors
5. Vote on the verdict and earn another **$500**

**Warning:** If you sign up and don't show, that's a **$3,000** fine. The court doesn't play.

### As a Lawyer

#### Passing the Bar

1. Find the **Bar Association** desk at City Hall
2. Pay the exam fee (just **$1** - basically free)
3. Take the 8-question exam covering:
   - Who's at fault in traffic accidents
   - When can cops make arrests
   - Evidence and subpoena rules
   - Ethics of legal practice
4. Pass the exam and wait for your background check
5. Collect your shiny **Bar License ID Card**

Now you can:
- Represent clients in court (and charge them handsomely)
- Interview suspects at police stations
- File motions and subpoenas
- Look important carrying a briefcase

**Important:** Always carry your Bar License. Police and judges will ask to see it.

### As a Judge

Judges run the show. They:
- Call cases to order
- Rule on objections ("Sustained!" or "Overruled!")
- Instruct the jury
- Hand down sentences
- Look intimidating in robes

*Judge positions are typically appointed or elected.*

## How a Trial Works

### Before the Big Day

1. Both sides get summoned via phone
2. Lawyers gather evidence and witnesses
3. Everyone prepares their arguments
4. Show up 10 minutes early (seriously)

### The Main Event

**Opening Statements** - Both sides tell the jury what they're going to prove

**Prosecution's Case** - They present evidence, call witnesses, try to prove guilt

**Defense's Case** - Time to poke holes in everything and create reasonable doubt

**Closing Arguments** - Last chance to sway the jury

**Jury Deliberation** - Jurors go argue amongst themselves

**The Verdict** - Guilty? Not guilty? The tension is real.

### After the Verdict

If you're found guilty:
- Judge announces your sentence
- Fines get added to your tab
- Jail time gets scheduled
- Your criminal record gets updated (this follows you!)

If you're acquitted:
- Walk out with your head held high
- Maybe reconsider your life choices anyway

## Criminal Records

Everything gets logged. Past convictions affect:
- Future sentencing (repeat offenders beware)
- Background checks
- Some job opportunities
- How judges view you in future cases

Some records can potentially be expunged - talk to a lawyer about that.
