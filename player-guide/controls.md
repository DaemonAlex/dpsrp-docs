## Tips for New Players

1. **Practice in quiet areas** - Get comfortable with controls before busy situations
2. **Rebind if needed** - Settings allow custom keybinds
3. **Ask for help** - Other players usually help newcomers
4. **This guide is always here** - `F10` opens it anytime

> *The controls feel overwhelming at first. Everyone goes through it. Give yourself a few hours and they'll become second nature. Before you know it, you'll be driving, shooting, and talking without thinking about keys at all.*

**Take your time. Master the basics. The city will wait.**
