*Where the wheels of democracy turn (slowly)*

*"Vote for me, and I promise lower taxes, better roads, and a chicken in every pot!"*

Welcome to Los Santos politics, where the Mayor runs the city, taxes fund the chaos, and anyone with enough ambition (and charisma) can run for office.

## The Power Structure

### The Mayor

The big boss of Los Santos. Elected by the people, for the people... or so they claim.

**What the Mayor Does:**
- Sets tax rates (your paycheck cries)
- Controls the city budget
- Grants funding to businesses
- Makes important city decisions
- Looks important at ribbon-cutting ceremonies

### City Hall Staff

The worker bees who keep government running:
- Process paperwork
- Handle elections
- Manage appointments
- Answer your questions about taxes

## Elections: Your Shot at Power

Ever looked at the Mayor and thought "I could do better"? Here's your chance.

### Running for Office

1. **Register as a candidate** at City Hall
2. **Campaign hard** - shake hands, make promises
3. **Wait for polls to open** - staff controls election timing
4. **Get votes** - charm the citizens
5. **Win!** (hopefully) - or try again next time

### Voting

Democracy in action! Here's how to participate:

1. Head to City Hall during an election
2. Find the voting booths
3. Review the candidates
4. Cast your vote
5. Wait anxiously for results

**Remember:** One citizen, one vote. No stuffing ballot boxes!

### Available Elections

The city holds elections for:
- **Mayor** - Run the whole show
- **Police Chief** - Lead law enforcement
- **EMS Chief** - Command medical services

## Taxes: The Unavoidable Truth

*"In this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes."* - Benjamin Franklin (probably playing GTA)

### What Gets Taxed

| Type | Rate | When You Pay |
|------|------|--------------|
| Income | 15% | Every paycheck |
| Items | Variable | Buying stuff |
| Vehicles | Variable | Car purchases |
| Housing | Variable | Property deals |
| Business | Variable | Running a company |

*Rates can change based on the Mayor's decisions*

### Where Your Money Goes

Your hard-earned (or not so honestly earned) tax dollars fund:
- Police departments (all seven of them!)
- EMS and Fire services
- Roads and infrastructure
- City programs and services
- The Mayor's... "discretionary budget"

### Mayor's Tax Powers

The Mayor can adjust tax rates:
- **Raise taxes** to fund more services
- **Lower taxes** to boost the economy (and win votes)
- **Target specific taxes** - income, sales, property, etc.

*Smart citizens pay attention to who they vote for!*

### Registering Your Business
