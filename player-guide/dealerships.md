### Financing

Can't afford full price? Finance it.

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Down Payment** | 10% of vehicle price |
| **Interest Rate** | 10% total |
| **Payments** | 12 installments |
| **Frequency** | Every 24 hours (real time) |

### Example: $100,000 Vehicle

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Down Payment | $10,000 |
| Amount Financed | $90,000 |
| Interest (10%) | $9,000 |
| Total Owed | $99,000 |
| Monthly Payment | $8,250 |

### How to Finance

1. Select vehicle at dealership
2. Choose "Finance" option
3. Pay the down payment
4. Vehicle is registered to you
5. Make payments on schedule

> **The Finance Deal:**
> *"Look, I can only put down ten thousand right now." The salesman nods, tapping at his tablet. "That's fine. Twelve payments of eight-two-fifty. Miss a payment and..." He draws his finger across his throat. "Repo. Understand?" You understand perfectly.*

### Payment Management

**Automatic Deductions:**
- Payments pull from your bank automatically
- Keep funds available on payment days
- Check payment status in your phone banking app

**Missing Payments:**
| What Happens | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Insufficient funds | Payment fails |
| Multiple misses | Vehicle repossessed |
| Repossession | Lose vehicle, lose payments made |

> **Warning:** Don't overextend. A repossessed car means lost money and no wheels.

## Tips for First-Time Buyers

1. **Start modest** - Your first car doesn't need to be a supercar
2. **Prioritize reliability** - Get where you need to go
3. **Consider costs** - Fuel, repairs, insurance
4. **Think about storage** - Where will you park it?
5. **Save for the future** - Your dream car can wait

> **The First Car:**
> *It's not pretty. The paint's faded. The engine rattles. But when you turn that key and it starts? When you pull out of the lot in YOUR car? None of that matters. This is freedom. This is the beginning.*

## The Bottom Line

Buying a car is one of the biggest purchases you'll make in Los Santos. Take your time. Test drive. Do the math. Whether you're getting your first beater or your dream supercar, make sure it's the right choice.
