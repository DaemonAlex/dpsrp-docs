## The Dream of Ownership

> *You've been crashing on couches for weeks. Motels when you could afford them. But tonight, standing in front of YOUR door, key in hand... this is different. This is yours. You unlock it, step inside, and exhale. Finally. A place to call home.*

In Los Santos, real estate isn't just about four walls and a roof - it's about **status**, **security**, and **sanctuary**. Whether you're buying your first studio apartment or selling a Vinewood mansion, the property game has rules worth knowing.

*Your new life, one tap away*

### For the Independent Buyer

Don't need hand-holding? The app is your friend.

**How It Works:**
1. Open your phone (`F1`)

| **Location** | Neighborhood matters |
| **Garage Slots** | How many cars? |

*Every property tells a story - what's yours worth?*

### Preparing to Sell

Thinking of cashing out? Here's how to maximize your return:

**Before Listing:**
| Task | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Clean the place** | First impressions matter |

- Take a commission (worth it for high-value properties)

**Option C: Direct Sale**
- Find your own buyer
- Negotiate privately
- Transfer property directly
- Keep all the profit

> **RP Scenario:**
> *"Look, I'll be straight with you," the buyer says, hands in pockets. "The place needs work. Foundation's questionable. That's not a $500K house." You cross your arms. "It's Vinewood. You're not paying for the walls - you're paying for the zip code." The negotiation begins.*

### Pricing Strategy

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Market Value** | No rush, want fair price |
