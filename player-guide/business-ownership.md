#### Operations
Businesses operate like GTA Online:

- **Sales** - Sell products for profit

#### Upgrades
Invest in your business:
| Upgrade | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Equipment | Faster production |
| Employees | More efficient |
| Security | Reduced raid chance |

### Supply Methods

**Buying Supplies**
- Costs money
- Instant delivery (with wait time)
- Safe method

**Stealing Supplies**
- Free
- Risky missions
- Less supplies per run

### Selling Products

Products are sold based on location:
| Region | Multiplier |
|--------|------------|
| Los Santos | $450/product |
| Blaine County | $600/product |
| Paleto Bay | $800/product |

Farther sales = More money but more risk!

### Storage Capacity

Each business has limits:
- **Supplies** - Raw materials
- **Products** - Finished goods
- **Research** - Upgrades/unlocks

Upgrade equipment to increase capacity.
